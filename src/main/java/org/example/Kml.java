            <LatLonBox>
            Specifies where the top, bottom, right, and left sides of a bounding box for the ground overlay are aligned.
                <north> Specifies the latitude of the north edge of the bounding box, in decimal degrees from 0 to ±90.
                <south> Specifies the latitude of the south edge of the bounding box, in decimal degrees from 0 to ±90.
                <east>  Specifies the longitude of the east edge of the bounding box, in decimal degrees from 0 to ±180.
                        (For overlays that overlap the meridian of 180° longitude, values can extend beyond that range.)
                <west>  Specifies the longitude of the west edge of the bounding box, in decimal degrees from 0 to ±180.
                        (For overlays that overlap the meridian of 180° longitude, values can extend beyond that range.)
                <rotation> Specifies a rotation of the overlay about its center, in degrees. Values can be ±180. The default is 0 (north).
                        Rotations are specified in a counterclockwise direction.
